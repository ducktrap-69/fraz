                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>
                    While walking through the old centre of Funchal, the capital
                    of Madeira, I was preparing myself a bit to see how I could
                    connect different stories in time. The Madeira University, a
                    Portuguese public university founded in 1988, established
                    its headquarters in an impressive old building originally
                    founded by the Jesuits community in the 16th century.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These academic headquarters was the location where I found
                    myself having a dialogue on Female Leadership and Managing
                    Change with Dr. Elsa Fernandes, vice dean of the Madeira
                    University on February 23rd, 2023. I was convinced that Dr.
                    Elsa, a professional in mathematics and an inspiring leader,
                    could share with me a variety of stories which would enable
                    me to bridge the past with an innovative academic future
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While entering this ancient building I walked over
                    cobblestones and massive old staircases breathing the art of
                    craftsmen of centuries back. I felt at ease. I approached
                    the reception and asked for Dr. Elsa.
                  </p>

                      dois minutos, por favor?…’ <br />
                      …’Claro Signora, nao problema. Deixe-me saber sempre que
                      ela esta pronta para me encontrar…’ I replied.

                    A strong Portuguese espresso with a small pastel da nata
                    compensated the waiting time
                  </p>

                  <h3>The Dialogue</h3>

                  <p>
                    I introduced the dialogue topics to Dr. Elsa Fernandes,
                    currently focusing on new ways of learning in education, and
                    kicked off the conversation with the question: can you share
                    a story and some of your experiences about a change process
                    which impacted your professional life?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She nodded and collected her thoughts. She prepared our
                    dialogue by sharing a project: how to improve the
                    educational teaching process by developing a new methodology
                    and tools for teachers in mathematics in Madeira. The
                    project started in 2006 and lasted until 2014. The
                    Portuguese government approached Dr. Elsa to implement
                    necessary innovations in learning mathematics to create
                    better results. A main condition in order to achieve the
                    expected results was to have more motivated students in
                    primary schools and high schools in Madeira. The focus was
                    on teachers across Madeira, their mindsets and attitudes
                    towards students and their colleagues as obviously this is
                    one of the critical success factors as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Elsa was aware of the technical aspects of the project,
                    however, even more focused of the nontechnical parts of the
                    project: how to change the ways of teaching, more
                    specifically the mindset and behaviour of these experienced
                    professionals?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dr. Elsa shared: ‘important for my project-team, consisting
                    of 14 female teachers and myself as the leader of this
                    change process, was to focus on how to change the mindset
                    and the attitude of all our Madeiran colleagues during the
                    process of teaching maths. How to guide a student who will
                    be at the centre of this learning process? We need to focus
                    on long-term results by asking ourselves after completing
                    the change: how to sustain the initial achieved results?’
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This challenging story reminded me of an academic project I,
                    myself, managed in the Netherlands around 2004: how to guide
                    professionals of several universities of applied sciences to
                    guide students who should be in the epicentre of any
                    learning process? The challenge at that time was to trigger,
                    stimulate and motivate the professors to add a more coaching
                    and guiding style of teaching to their usual approach. I can
                    share that this wasn’t an easy task for everyone. In
                    Madeira, the challenge was apparently the same in 2006. I
                    shared that story with Dr. Elsa and we both agreed that
                    irrespective of time, disciplines, and location, changing
                    teaching methodologies according to the needs of the
                    end-users, will always be key in the area of knowledge
                    institutions.

                    I was more than curious about the setup of her team in 2006.
                    ‘Why were only female teachers part of your team?’, I asked.
                    Male teachers apparently had other priorities she explained
                    to me. They were too busy or realized that the project would
                    have an impact on themselves as an individual professional:
                    a change in their mindset and behaviour was a must and the
                    question was if they were ready. I told them clearly, they
                    could join the project at any time, if they felt ready
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Dr. Elsa continued her story by expressing her philosophy
                    and vision of the project of developing and implementing new
                    ways of teaching in mathematics:

                      …’Our philosophy and vision was to train all the teachers
                      in Madeira in the newly developed teaching methodologies
                      and tools. We collaborated intensively with them from day
                      one and supported them during tough moments. We also were
                      present in the classrooms to figure out together what
                      could be the best answer to new questions from the
                      students since we worked with new ways of working. It was
                      very exciting, yet scary at times too.…’

                  <blockquote class="mb-40 mt-40">
                    <p>
                      ‘...Well, first of all, I trained my small team of 14
                      people by myself. I trained them in more technically
                      oriented innovations and how to develop all kind of new
                      methodologies and tools. Moreover, I focused on how to
                      guide the required change on individual and team level at
                      all the schools and lyceums of Madeira Island. The content
                      of the implementation was clear. The process of the
                      implementation on such a scale was new, for all of
                      us…especially how to lead and guide all the unexpected
                      changes with the people involved.’

                    Dr. Elsa was quicker than me taking my next breath and said:
                    ‘before you ask your next question Marianne, which is
                    probably about scaling up the project, I would like to
                    mention something else. Our strong team of 14 members having
                    the responsibility of implementing something so new was one
                    of the success factors of this project. Without this team we
                    were not be able to realize the educational goals of the
                    Portuguese Government. Furthermore, it was values that
                    brought us to success as well. Values like respect, two-way
                    communication and trust were and still are main conditions
                    for us to collaborate and communicate. You know when you are
                    respected or disrespected. In my view, when you talk about
                    change, it’s all about human engineering. As a leader you
                    must be aware and behave accordingly. Indeed, modelling
                    behaviour plays an important role to keep the team and the
                    goals in place. I felt this as my responsibility throughout
                    the journey.’

                      ‘We started to implement the project with a pilot of 50
                      teachers. After achieving the first round of goals we
                      trained the teachers such so that they could take it
                      forward themselves and train their colleagues in the same
                      methodologies and tools. Simultaneously, we supported them
                      in guiding their colleagues through the change process. We
                      started with 50 teachers first, then 150, up to 250 and so
                      on. While sharing this story to you Marianne, I hardly
                      believe how much work we have done to improve the
                      education and teaching methods of mathematics in Portugal.
                      I'm grateful for the competences I developed to lead
                      change. My passion for innovation, my love for my work and
                      my colleagues and the experiences led me to applying the
                      same in my personal lives. I got better in understanding
                      my fellow human beings during rocky times. I also
                      developed an ability to shift old habits to new and better
                      patterns. Patterns, invisible at the beginning of a
                      change, yet slowly appearing on the horizon while moving
                      along the change. And last but not the least, I surprised
                      myself with my perseverance. I will simply never give
                      up....’

                    I observed Dr. Elsa’s passion and pride. She was reliving
                    this change while taking me through the story of leading
                    change between 2006 to 2014. It was about tackling
                    resistance and reviewing happy and tough moments while
                    asking ourselves ‘did we achieve the results to sustain the
                    learnings for the future? She wondered what was left today
                    of the project completed in 2014? I empathised with her as I
                    know the feeling of completed projects you were once in
                    charge of. As if Dr. Elsa could read my mind, she continued:
                    ‘letting go is an important part of leading change, which is
                    easier said than done’. ‘...In my current work with lots of
                    responsibilities like AI, robotics, VR, and new ways of
                    doing research with newly developed teaching methodologies I
                    can apply all my learnings gained during this fantastic
                    project...’

                    I thanked Dr. Elsa Fernandes for her openness and honesty
                    and started walking towards the exit of this old and
                    characteristic building realising I was back into the 21st
                    century. I felt a fresh new spark of inspiring wisdom. I
                    walked to my old cafe near Rua da Santa Maria. The café had
                    a lovely owner and while chatting with him, he started to
                    share his knowledge on baking a sweet pastel de nata.
