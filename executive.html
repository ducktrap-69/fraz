                <h2>Your story</h2>
                <p>
                  Everybody has a lot of stories, including you and me. All
                  those stories represent our life experiences. Professional and
                  personal stories. Consciously or subconsciously you have
                  stored all your experiences in your ‘personal library’. This
                  library is a unique place being a reflection of your identity.
                  Your library may contain historical books, fiction/
                  nonfiction, science, sports, family-business or love, to name
                  a few categories. Irrespective the categories, you have stored
                  your experiences by yourself. How does your library look like?
                  Do you feel the need to reorganize your library?
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you choose to create a new story you might have to say
                  goodbye to a few old books in your library without forgetting
                  them. Sometimes you have to pave a new path whether you decide
                  to develop a new story by yourself. Or is it a new experience
                  forcing you to think about taking new directions? One thing is
                  for sure: life will continue and new stories will challenge
                  you to empty a few of your shelves to make space for new books
                  in your ‘personal library’. That’s what life is all about,
                  isn’t it?
                </p>
                <p>
                  The last 30 years I had the privilege to listen to all kinds
                  of stories in the business world. I supported the development
                  of new stories of professionals, managers and leaders. That’s
                  what coaching is all about. Inspiring personalities opened up
                  to me and were willing to share their uniqueness and
                  vulnerability while taking next steps in their lives. I am
                  grateful for being able to support them. My passion is to
                  continue supporting people who are on a cross road and wonder
                  which direction they would like to take. Or perhaps should
                  take.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The question is how to take your next step. How do you become
                  aware of the fact that you need to reshuffle the books in your
                  own library? How to let go of past experiences? Or maybe you
                  just need to remove some dust from existing books?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Whatever your story is you are the director of your own life
                  and experiences. You are the owner of that next chapter. This
                  can be done by yourself or with the support of an executive
                  coach.
                </p>
                <h3>Executive coaching in a nutshell</h3>
                <p>
                  It’s all about supporting people in their unique process of
                  decision-making while being on a crossroad in (business) life.
                  The process of coaching will trigger you to develop new future
                  scenarios and to draw creative roadmaps in order to clearly
                  see the new stories of your professional and personal life.
                  Coaching is also handholding while you enhance your skills,
                  explore new competences and build new paradigms to write next
                  chapters.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In my experience competences like reflection, empathy,
                  anticipation and imagination are part of the ‘art of
                  coaching’. Guiding people to their next levels means coaching
                  as well as training them in creative mindsets, new competences
                  and unique leadership styles.
                </p>

                  Working together means trying to understand and respect each
                  other. Values like openness to learn, curiosity and building
                  trust are key. These are core values while we listen to each
                  other’s stories and start the process of coaching. Every
                  personality is unique and has a past while living in the
                  presence and dreaming about the future. Is the past too much
                  present in the presence? Let’s face it and see how we can
                  store past experiences on empty shelves in your ‘personal
                  library’. How about your future? Does it look blurred? Or is
                  the future in full colour including your dreams? Let’s face
                  that too and visualize the road ahead.

                  Depending on your question(s), your challenge(s) or your
                  ambition(s), we can think of various sessions with different
                  coaching formulas. Think of one session of 4 hours, or a full
                  day session. Or perhaps it will be more convenient to spread
                  out several sessions over a period of a few weeks or a couple
                  of months. We will find a suitable formula to collaborate.

                  Furthermore, HR, L&D or consultants in corporate or
                  governmental organizations can be trained in coaching and/or
                  intervision techniques through train-the-trainer sessions.
