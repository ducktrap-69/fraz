                  <h3>Introduction</h3>
                  <p>
                    While standing in front of the most stunning palaces in
                    India (Mysore Palace), I took a deep breath to control my
                    level of excitement. I stood there with a three-dimensional:
                    keeping the history alive, living in the presence, and
                    wondering what the history of the future could possibly look
                    like.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While driving through the palatial gate, I was awaited a
                    warm welcome and support to enter the palace and make myself
                    comfortable. For a moment, I felt a little bit like a queen
                    myself. I was guided to the visitorâ€™s room to wait until the
                    queen herself was ready. I absorbed the history via books at
                    display, paintings on the wall, the furniture, and the
                    atmosphere in this room. There was a vibe created by
                    everyone working in the palace with one common goal: to
                    protect the history and to connect the dots with the future.
                  </p>
                  <h3>The dialogue</h3>

                  <blockquote class="mb-40 mt-40">
                    <p>
                      â€˜Can you share a story about a change process that
                      impacted your life?â€™ I asked to Mrs. Pramoda. She nodded
                      and replied â€˜Many changes happened in my personal life.
                      Change that impacted me as a person, as a family and as
                      the entire Mysore community. As soon as you can review the
                      change youâ€™re dealing with, it is key to reflect on
                      yourself about the impact it had on you. Reflection is key
                      to be able to continue your life with the enriched
                      experience called change, I think that is what change is
                      all about. The challenge is how to get back on track after
                      an intense disruption for example like the unexpected
                      passing of my dear husband.â€™
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      â€˜A lot of change impacted my life on which I never could
                      have anticipated. It uncovered many of my talents of which
                      I wasnâ€™t aware of yet, and it increased my strength to
                      understand who I really am, and that is what matters. My
                      late husband had full confidence in me, even though at
                      times I was living in the shadow of public life. He had
                      the capacity to fully observe and sense my strengths. He
                      probably knew me better than I knew myself at that time.
                      After his death, however, I never thought of applying my
                      hidden talents. I needed these talents to maintain the
                      Mysore heritage, the beauty of the family and to get back
                      on track as a person to lead the Mysore community on my
                      own, without my husband by my side.â€™
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      â€˜To be honest, I explored an interesting kind of
                      possessiveness within myself. I am not talking about being
                      self-centered or ego-centric in any way, however this
                      possessiveness of mine comes from my responsibility
                      towards the heritage, and the historical value for
                      generations to come. Is there anybody in this world who
                      understands all situations that happened between the year
                      1300 and today that pushed mankind to its next stage of
                      development? If you donâ€™t understand your roots, you canâ€™t
                      understand who you are as a human being and your
                      contribution to everyone around you. I feel I am
                      constantly trying to achieve the ambition to create a
                      balance between our assets, its value, the legacy, and the
                      ability to make others understand history such that they
                      can understand themselves better. Furthermore, the number
                      of enthusiastic visitors coming to our palace every single
                      day demonstrates the need to understand oneâ€™s own part in
                      history. I am eager to facilitate that process by keeping
                      our family history intact and share our history as
                      transparent and accessible as possible. It gives me
                      immense pride to do that.â€™
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I was blown away of Mrs. Pramodaâ€™s knowledge and
                      experiences and continued with my next question. How are
                      you managing the challenges, hurdles, and pitfalls you
                      face in times of change? Especially when you have the
                      ambition to stay true to your passion and
                      responsibilities.

                  <p>
                    First of all, I am a team player. You canâ€™t manage change
                    all by yourself. However, at the same time, I need my
                    privacy and time alone to reflect on life in general, myself
                    and everything that I experience, day by day. It might sound
                    like a paradox, but change requires both time for individual
                    self-reflection and team support. I like the humor between
                    people and will always try to stimulate people to laugh
                    more. Humor grounds us and connects us.

                    I asked Mrs. Pramoda â€˜what about cultural patterns and
                    habits? Do we need to break through vicious circles?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    â€˜We need to maintain and respect habits. Sometimes you must
                    be more creative and see what you can organize around
                    existing habits to perhaps unlearn a few and create a few
                    new ones. The journey between ~ 3 ~ getting rid of old
                    habits and establish new habits is challenging. We have
                    cultural and religious habits on an annual basis which we
                    celebrate every year. Therefore, it is my responsibility and
                    motivation to revive these habits which will enrich our
                    people. I love this process! The only constant in life is
                    change, hence we need to respect existing habits but also
                    embrace new habits we learn throughout. We can never be
                    â€˜frogs in a wellâ€¦â€™ (Kupa Manduka).

                  <h3>Breaking cultural patterns and habits (or not)</h3>

                  <p>
                    The dialogue between Mrs. Pramoda and me change from a more
                    personal level to a more professional level: how to manage
                    change as a female leader? Are female leaders more sensitive
                    and maybe more effective in â€˜making it happenâ€™?
                  </p>
                  <blockquote class="mb-40 mt-40">
                    <p>
                      â€˜Sometimes, we need to break through patterns if the
                      circle of habits doesnâ€™t allow us to take the next step in
                      development. Are current patterns functional or somewhat
                      dysfunctional for the evolutions of us, humans?

                    What kind of personal (or professional) tools you use to
                    support your community in a change process? Mrs. Pramoda
                    started her answer with a firm tone of voice by saying: â€˜let
                    me share some believes and experiences with you. I believe
                    every person on earth is trying to do its utmost best to do
                    good, or even more than that. The circumstances, however,
                    arenâ€™t allowing us sometimes â€˜to do goodâ€™. I have the
                    competence â€˜to do goodâ€™ and support others to do the same. I
                    use my sensitivity in the best possible way to guide that
                    process: accept, adapt, and accelerate. I also firmly
                    believe that one should ridicule oneself, or to make jokes
                    about oneself. Why? It keeps you in the presence, you should
                    never take yourself too seriously, which means you canâ€™t
                    escape reality. That is managing change from my point of
                    view.â€™
                  </p>

                  <h3>Competences and paradoxes</h3>
                  <p>
                    â€˜You know Marianne, Mrs. Pramoda continued, I am lazy, very
                    lazy and at the same time a workaholic.â€™ I started laughing
                    out loud as it sounded very familiar to me. â€˜Yes, she
                    continued, I am very well organized in my mind, however in
                    my daily work I am not organized at all.â€™
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I just loved the paradoxes Mrs. Pramoda shared. I shared my
                    impression about her being a very strong female leader. She
                    looked at me with a bit of disbelief. Connecting peopleâ€™s
                    hearts is the most powerful connection a leader can achieve.
                    Supporting others from that perspective is even more
                    powerful in the sense of being connected, a universal
                    strength required amongst female leaders, especially in
                    India
                  </p>
                  <blockquote class="mb-40 mt-40">
                    <p>
                      So, you do the same? Mrs. Pramoda asked me. We started
                      laughing again. I asked Mrs. Pramoda assistant to unpack
                      my gift for her. While she unwrapped the painting, she
                      said: â€˜Oh, this is the palace in Bangalore!â€™
                    </p>

                  <h3>History</h3>
                  <p>
                    My visit to the Queen of Mysore, Mrs. Pramoda was
                    enlightening and at the same time a reflection of â€˜female
                    powerâ€™. I introduced our responsibility to initiate and
                    support the awareness of passion, ambitions, and confidence
                    with younger female (potential) leaders. We, as experienced
                    leaders, with respect to our unique personality, different
                    backgrounds and experiences, can share and guide young
                    female leaders into new paradigms, even outside the borders
                    of Karnataka.
                  </p>

                  <blockquote class="mb-40 mt-40">
                    <p>
                      â€˜Yesâ€™, she replied, â€˜let me know how to take this further!
                      Young leaders need to learn to rely on their intuition and
                      going forward in life, whatever it takes.â€™ She offered me
                      a private tour through the palace which I immediately
                      accepted. I was looking forward to breathing in years of
                      ancient history hidden in these palace walls and
                      understand better who we all are today. The history is
                      still alive. And the proof of female leadership? No doubt
                      about that! It will always be a never-ending story.â€™
