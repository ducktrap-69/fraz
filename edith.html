                  <h3>Going back in time</h3>
                  <p>
                    Amsterdam, the Dutch capital, was the place to be for the
                    many, including myself more than three years back. The year
                    2020, the year the pandemic introduced itself to the world,
                    managed to change the world completely leaving intense
                    challenges for politicians, entrepreneurs, CEO's, global
                    citizens, and people out on the streets. The biggest
                    challenge for all of us was how to proceed in the unknown.
                    Visiting Amsterdam in 2020 was quite a nostalgic visit after
                    inhaling the Dutch culture, habits and in particular the
                    ‘Goudse stroopwafels’ after so many years. Walking through
                    clean and organized streets where the wind and rain hits you
                    in the face and only a strong umbrella can prevent your
                    outfit from getting soaked. I still felt the desire to look
                    presentable for my business visits despite the Dutch weather
                    but could only manage that partly. Good old Dutch weather
                    and good old memories I thought to myself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the highlights of my visit in Amsterdam was to meet
                    with Mrs. Edith Nordmann LL.M, Managing Partner at ACG
                    International – Attorney Consulting Group. Edith is a Dutch
                    Attorney at Law, Mediator and Arbitrator, specialized in
                    corporate and commercial law with expert qualification in
                    Employment Law. We prepared our physical meeting via several
                    online meetings in which we discussed how to create an
                    inspiring and strong collaboration between the NICCT
                    (Netherlands India Chamber of Commerce and Trade) and the
                    INBCB (India Netherlands Business Circle Bangalore). I, the
                    president of the INBCB and Edith, the Chairman of the NICCT,
                    had the ambition to increase the traffic on the corridor
                    between India and the Netherlands. In fact, we developed a
                    motto for our meeting in real life: to be innovative in our
                    thinking and to challenge current paradigms for the better
                    of our mission, with respect to the differences in culture,
                    members, and local context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I took the train from The Hague to Amsterdam and while
                    entering the Atrium building at the Strawinskylaan I
                    revisited memory lane.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    How many times have I had inspiring events in this building,
                    or on the contrary challenging and tough meetings, great
                    round table sessions and strong Italian coffees with
                    business friends in earlier days? Many times, I can tell you
                    that.
                  </p>

                  <blockquote class="mb-40 mt-40">
                    <p>
                      '... Aahhh, Marianne, so happy we can meet in person
                      finally!’ Edith greeted me warmly. ‘You arrived yesterday?
                      Ok, so your internal clock is still adjusting itself to
                      the Dutch time zone. One strong coffee I suppose, right?
                      Please follow me to the boardroom and we will continue our
                      talks as usual...' Edith was right, my entire physique was
                      in jetlag mode. Though somehow, I knew that my dialogue
                      with Edith would trigger interesting questions and have
                      surprising twists. This would definitely bring me more
                      into the present and ease up my jetlag.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      'Edith, how nice to meet you, finally indeed.' I replied.
                      'How are you doing in this good old city? Did you know I
                      lived here for more than 10 years? I assume we won’t talk
                      about the differences between the Hague and Amsterdam, the
                      Indian and the Dutch diaspora in both cities and the
                      variety of restaurants selling 'broodjes kaas' or spicy
                      dosas...?' We both chuckled while I settled myself into
                      the boardroom.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      While we continued chatting around the agenda points,
                      Edith served a real Dutch home baked apple pie with of
                      course the strongest coffee ever. 'How did you know that
                      I'm a big fan of apple pies?' I asked her. 'Hmm, I assumed
                      that if you are living abroad and especially in India for
                      so many years, some Dutch habits will never leave you',
                      she replied. 'A piece of Dutch apple pie might just give
                      you the right boost before we start with our Indian Dutch
                      agenda.'
                    </p>
                  </blockquote>

                  <p>
                    This warm welcome formed the right base to kickstart our
                    dialogue. While we set the scene of our meeting more in
                    detail, our humor, our straightforwardness, our vast
                    experiences in our areas of expertise and
                    out-of-the-box-thinking helped us to get into the zone. We
                    didn’t forget about our mutual interests and country-related
                    business goals either. Setting up a strong collaboration
                    between India and the Netherlands on business level via the
                    NICCT and the INBCB was the need of the hour. Within two
                    hours we agreed on certain goals, responsibilities,
                    activities and paved the path for the coming two years.
                    Implementing those goals was the next challenge but also the
                    most interesting one. After agreeing on the drafts for an
                    MOU (Memorandum of Understanding), we signed the MOU during
                    the New Years' reception of the NICCT in January 2021.

                  <h3>Female Leadership</h3>

                  <blockquote class="mb-40 mt-40">
                    <p>
                      Three years later after we first met in Amsterdam, I
                      invited Edith to contribute to my applied research about
                      ‘Female Leadership and Managing Change’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I was impressed with her work attitude, the various board
                      positions she held including chairing supervisory boards
                      in the field of art and social work. She held these
                      positions while managing different turns in her career and
                      raising three children, all at the same time. ‘Being a
                      mother and co-manager of your own family during your
                      professional career, you learn to follow your guts and
                      intuition, especially during times where fast
                      decision-making is key. Interestingly that isn’t so much
                      different in doing business sometimes. I felt a constant
                      flow of leading unpredictable changes by and for people.’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I wondered where she learned these skills to move along in
                      life without losing her own ambitions. In a long virtual
                      call on a Sunday morning in July 2023 we continued our
                      dialogue. I listened to stories and a variety of
                      experiences in which a more human side of her legal
                      identity became visible. Standardized solutions and
                      ready-made legal frameworks in order to solve technically
                      oriented cases aren’t standard in Edith’s professional
                      life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Born and raised as a Swiss citizen, Edith followed her
                      school-life with discipline and adaptation to the
                      environmental requirements at an early age: 'You know
                      Marianne, I was very disciplined in high school and pretty
                      much outnumbered everybody in everything. I was the best
                      in class and received great support from my family to
                      follow my ambitions as a child. My family protected me
                      while achieving my dreams, following my intuition, and
                      achieving my goals. Going to Harvard was one of my
                      ambitions, however my grandfather told me: ‘if you are
                      going to study at Harvard, your life will consist of books
                      yet again and there is so much more in life. I would like
                      to recommend that you take a break for one year and start
                      working in a company abroad.’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ‘Marianne, I will never forget what my granddad said that
                      day. I listened to him and went to the Netherlands,
                      started a sales job, going from door to door, learned
                      Dutch on the spot and proposed a variety of new ideas to
                      the company. I learned to collaborate with a business
                      family and with people from different backgrounds. I think
                      that was one of the best experiences in my life where I
                      followed my intuition, listened to advice, took a few
                      risks and just did it. Sometimes you just need to start
                      and do it, spicing it up with perseverance.’

                  <h3>Leading by experience</h3>
                  <p>
                    I asked Edith if her experiences at such a young age, which
                    included starting and raising a family while studying law
                    and setting up a career, formed her as a leader. ‘Definitely
                    Marianne, the basics of leadership I learned at a young age
                    while always trying to keep in my mind what I want to
                    achieve, my horizon and supporting others to achieve their
                    dreams and their goals. Empathy, imagining how the world
                    will look like when you implement your dreams, anticipating
                    the impact of your decisions and not be afraid of learning
                    from your mistakes, are key elements. Well, I can tell you,
                    I made quite some mistakes, which I would like to call
                    'learning-opportunities' instead. I was always open to
                    receiving feedback and willing to 'repair' the consequences
                    of my actions and behavior.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That is, as we all know, not easy and sometimes you have to
                    compromise with your own ambitions to gain more insight into
                    business life and especially into your own profession.
                    Applying whatever you learned in your study isn’t mentioned
                    in a book which you can learn by heart.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I studied her while she connected events of her past
                    together and observed she wasn’t just memorizing her early
                    dynamic life consisting of international experiences. While
                    sharing her real-life stories, it was as if she watched her
                    own personal film again and narrated it at the same time.
                    Edith was able to share her stories in such a detailed
                    manner that it was similar to being in a cinema and
                    empathizing with the main character, both cognitively and
                    emotionally. For Edith, it was about imagination followed by
                    real life situations which was her way of sharing her story
                    about her family and career.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Balanced competences</h3>

                  <blockquote class="mb-40 mt-40">
                    <p>
                      'I always had the opportunity to create interesting jobs
                      for myself or join challenging projects with different law
                      firms. Studying law by heart is a totally different ball
                      game compared to applying that same knowledge. If you want
                      to contribute to society and people, you need the
                      competences to understand the actual clients’ needs and
                      their story behind the story they share with you. And
                      let’s not forget about the personal impact of each case on
                      the lives of clients. The question that arises then is how
                      we can best support them within a realistic timeframe, an
                      affordable budget, and sometimes uncontrolled emotions.
                      That's what social support should be all about: to help
                      our fellow humans within the context of the law, with our
                      juridical professionalism, our values and norms as best as
                      we can. Every lawyer needs the skill to balance the
                      cognitive aspects of our legal responsibilities and the
                      emotional aspects of our clients’ cases. These balances
                      should be flexible and may change over time.’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ‘Let me share with you a simple example. When I open a
                      meeting by welcoming the participants, my first questions
                      are: How are you doing today? What are your concerns?
                      Which hurdles do you feel to finalize the job successfully
                      and how can we help you out? As you can imagine Marianne,
                      a totally different dynamic will occur when you pose these
                      kinds of questions. People will open up, even though they
                      may feel a little uncomfortable at first, however they
                      will share their stories, the real story. They will share
                      their concerns about their case, the work that needs to be
                      done and, potential hurdles to be expected throughout the
                      process. By doing so, I have the real core of every case
                      in front of me in a short period of time. I take into
                      account the human side of our work in order to find the
                      most suitable and feasible solution. ‘My style and
                      approach are not always appreciated by everyone; however,
                      I believe that merely technically ticking off agenda
                      points is not effective at all. You simply ignore emotions
                      which are deeply embedded in the personalities sitting in
                      front of me.'

                  <p>
                    To my question whether scenario-thinking is an important
                    aspect of her professional responsibility, Edith replied:
                    'indeed, scenario thinking on an emotional level is one of
                    the critical success factors of our job. You need the
                    sensitivity to observe and intervene as well. Clients expect
                    that in a more subconscious way because solving problems of
                    a case is like 'seeing beyond' the problem. To find an
                    innovative solution for a complex problem, you can’t just
                    copy any solution you have implemented in the past. Each
                    case is unique. Therefore, managing the unpredictability of
                    finding a suitable and legally correct solution is in my
                    opinion the most interesting part of our job.'
                  </p>
                  <h3>Recommendations</h3>
                  <p>
                    After wrapping up our dialogue I asked Edith what kind of
                    recommendations she could share to motivate female leaders
                    who are equally managing constant change in their
                    professional (and personal) lives. ‘It is important to
                    develop a sensitivity to observe interactions between
                    people, anticipate their behaviors and see if you can
                    discover certain patterns in how people react and act. It
                    provides you with more insight into the story behind the
                    story, and how to lead the situation towards next steps.
                    Secondly don’t try to copy-paste 'men'. Being yourself, as a
                    woman, is essential to know who you are: what kind of person
                    am I and what suits me best, professionally, and personally.
                    Discovering the real ‘you’, takes time. And last but not the
                    least: listen to your guts, don’t ever ignore your
                    intuition. We, as female leaders, are working very hard and
                    we shouldn’t be ashamed in being rewarded for that!’
