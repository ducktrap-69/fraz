                    The main question that was asked was: how to implement a
                    five-year vision in an organisation active in the aviation
                    sector? And it wasn't just that. How to ensure that all
                    professionals and managers understand and feel aligned and
                    motivated to bridge the gap between the current and desired
                    situation of the company? 120 people from sales, marketing
                    and HR developed plans and roadmaps for the coming years
                    while answering the question: what is in it for me and how
                    can I best contribute? With practical and creative
                    simulations, everybody started to imagine how they saw the
                    near future for the company and what potential changes might
                    occur. The end result was extremely tangible: they
                    co-created a glossy magazine with personal stories and what
                    critical success factors are required for change. Everybody
                    involved was so motivated that the magazine was developed
                    within 24 hours by the 120 participants together in New
                    Delhi (India). The beauty lies in a concrete product created
                    collectively with lessons learned to guide their next
                    change. That certainly brings motivation!

                    A company was struggling with how to reduce the lead time of
                    innovation within R&D departments in order to stay ahead of
                    the competition globally? In collaboration with internal
                    consultants from Eindhoven, Hasselt (Belgium) and Nijmegen
                    (Netherlands), the marketing department and the pilot
                    factory of the company developed a detailed overview of the
                    R&D steps covering the range: from idea to market. We
                    focused on interdisciplinary communication, entrepreneurship
                    and teambuilding. Can we put ourselves into the shoes of a
                    marketing professional while we are R&D experts and vice
                    versa? Empathy and understanding each other's perspectives
                    was key in order for the professionals to feel ownership of
                    the new ways of working. Together with the client we were
                    able to achieve that within 6 months via simulations,client
                    interviews and feedback, piloting and coaching on the job.

                    In this sector there were multiple challenges to be tackled
                    at the same time. How to increase profit after five years of
                    stagnation, how to strengthen international collaboration
                    among different units across Asia Pacific and how to become
                    aware of the right behaviour fit for the local market? A big
                    task at hand for 200 professionals from the trading sector
                    of IKEA in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. All of
                    this while keeping in mind the 4000 suppliers in the local
                    textile industry that had to work according to IKEA values.
                    During a 10-months training and coaching on the job, with a
                    variety of training activities in different countries,
                    theoretical and practical learnings on change and social
                    innovation, leadership and entrepreneurship were key. The

                    Even though we have worked with various healthcare
                    organisations across Europe and India, we are keen to
                    highlight one in particular. This eye-hospital in South
                    India asked us: how can we best increase patients'
                    satisfaction in our eye hospitals and improve communication
                    between our medical and administrative staff in Pondicherry,
                    Madurai and Coimbatore, India? After receiving a
                    train-the-trainer program on client focus, survey methods,
                    effective communication and team building, the HR staff and
                    the nurses were able to develop, guide and analyse the
                    results of a tailor-made survey for 4000 patients. The
                    survey results were analysed and implemented on the job
                    immediately. We were amazed with the motivation and drive of
                    the staff after they understood the patients' feedback! The
                    level of satisfaction with patients increased over time
                    making the medical staff realise that communication and
                    interaction is key. We prepared the medical staff in
                    leadership and change skills to increase their confidence in
                    leading change by themselves in the future. For three
                    consecutive years, participants received refreshment courses
                    and train-the-trainer sessions in order to sustain the
                    change.

                    Out of all the sectors we have contributed with our products
                    and services in the last 40 years, one of the main areas we
                    constantly invest and share our knowledge and experiences is
                    the education sector: we believe in a journey of 'Education
                    Permanente', or in other words continuous learning. It's our
                    contribution to people who are eager to stay ahead of time,
                    which is a main condition to sustain the development of
                    mankind, wherever you are - whoever you are. In all our
                    programs on change and innovation stakeholders from academic
                    institutions, the industry and the society are involved. In
                    our experience it is a critical success factor to prepare
                    students and learning organizations for the ability to
                    survive, to add value to their own environment and to
                    contribute to a better world. We triggered thousands of
                    students to explore their hidden competencies. How to become
                    more aware of the need for a sustainable society and how to
                    guide our friends and colleagues to take next steps in their
                    development and grab opportunities to realize dreams? During
                    an extensive MBA program for 150 Indian students in New
                    Delhi, we involved multiple industries, governmental
                    organizations and competitors of the university as well. How
                    to reduce the lead time between a students' graduation and
                    industrial requirements for jobs in a global market? This
                    was one of the main objectives of the program. Another
                    example was a 6-months program we executed in Bangalore in
                    which nine universities competed against each other to get
                    the award for best idea in which sustainability, feasibility
                    and profitability played a crucial role.Out of 550 ideas, 50
                    were selected on the basis of which the student teams
                    created a start-up to pilot their idea and experience

                    the lead times to implement innovations including leading
                    the process of change at the same time. In collaboration
                    with two academic institutions we guided the process of data
                    gathering and analysis, scenario development, defining
                    actions and piloting those through simulations. The purpose
                    was to prepare the Indian factory in the best possible way
                    for what it actually means to implement their innovations.
                    While closely collaborating with the Production and HR team,
                    we trained these professionals in such a way they could

                    The main challenge here was how to embrace sustainability
                    and invest in 'green markets' instead. We designed vision
                    development sessions, created new SWOT analysis and roadmaps
                    based on strategic options for the near future. Through this
                    approach the bank managers got inspired to step out of their
                    'old paradigms' and create new ones while sustaining
                    business as usual. Over four extensive sessions new ways of
                    thinking and working were introduced as well as fine tuning
                    the most suitable organizational behavior. The management
                    team and professionals felt more than confident to enter new
                    markets and to convince their clients to conduct business
                    more sustainably.

                      While standing in front of the most stunning palaces in
                      India (Mysore Palace), I took a deep breath to control my
                      level of excitement. I stood there with a
                      three-dimensional: keeping the history alive, living in
                      the presence, and wondering what the history of the future
                      could possibly look like.
